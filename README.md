Designed to serve as a new tool for handcraft feature extraction (FE) it improves the elementary analysis provided by signal energy (E) and enhances the humble spectral investigation granted by zero-crossing rates (ZCR). Python code is presented here for both the DPT as well as the inverse transform, IDPT, allowing for perfect reconstruction of the signal.
